# YWHAG-in-cancer-EMT

This project contains the R scripts of transcriptomics and kinomics analysis to understand the role of YWHAG in cancer EMT.
The manuscript is currently under review by Advanced Science.

# Manuscript 
YWHAG deficiency disrupts the EMT-associated network to induce oxidative cell death and prevent metastasis

# Data
Figure3A contains the cell-cell Euclidean distance of MKN74 treated with TGF-beta (TGFB_wide.txt) or DMOG (DMOG_wide.txt) to induce cancer EMT. The cells were transfected with siYWHAG to examine the effect of YWHAG during EMT. Various kinase inhibitors were used to identify protein kinases that are dependent on YWHAG to coordinate EMT-associated cellular network.

# Rscripts
"Figure3A" contains the R scripts to illustrate the temporal changes of cell-cell Euclidean distance over 48 hours and to shortlist YWHAG-dependent kinases involved in cancer EMT.

#FigureS1A" describes the correlation analysis between YWHAG and HSP90AA1 using the transcriptomes of 21 TCGA tumor types.
